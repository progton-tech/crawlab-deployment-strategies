# Crawlab Deployment Strategies

Welcome to the official repository for Crawlab deployment strategies! This repository provides ready-to-use templates for deploying the Crawlab crawling framework using Docker and Kubernetes.

## About Crawlab

Crawlab is an open-source framework designed to simplify the deployment, management, and scaling of web crawlers. With Crawlab, users can efficiently manage their crawling strategies in a production environment.

## Deployment Strategies

This repository includes two main deployment strategies:

### Docker

Deploy Crawlab using Docker for a simplified containerized environment. The Docker deployment strategy is ideal for users looking for an easy and quick setup.

### Kubernetes

For scalable and robust deployment, use the Kubernetes strategy. It's perfect for managing larger deployments of Crawlab across multiple nodes.

## Getting Started
